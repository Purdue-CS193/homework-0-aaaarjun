# AJ's First CS193 Homework

- I like the small class sizes
- I appreciate how when it looked like I was having trouble, ryan came over to my computer to help me
- I'm glad this course is teaching knowledge that I'll be applying practically in an acual job (as opposed to CS180blk)
- I appreciate how fast you guys replied to my email
